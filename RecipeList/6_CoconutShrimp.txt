Ingredients

12 oz bag small frozen shrimp, thawed
1 cup cornstarch
1 tsp salt
1 tsp black pepper
Vegetable oil for frying
1/2 cup coconut milk
1/4 cup condensed milk
3 tbsp mayonnaise

Instructions

Heat oil to 350 in a skillet or pan. While oil is heating up, put cornstarch, salt, and pepper in a Ziploc bag.
Add shrimp to cornstarch mixture and shake until fully coated. Remove shrimp from bag and fry until light golden brown or shrimp appear pink under the breading. Drain on a paper towel until ready to use.
Combine the mayonnaise, coconut milk & condensed milk in a sauce pan over medium high heat. Heat until it comes to a boil, continuously stirring to prevent burning – about 5 minutes.
Toss shrimp into coconut mixture and bring just to a boil, then turn off the skillet.
