Coconut Shrimp

Ingredients

12 oz bag small frozen shrimp, thawed
1 cup cornstarch
1 tsp salt
1 tsp black pepper
Vegetable oil for frying
1/2 cup coconut milk
1/4 cup condensed milk
3 tbsp mayonnaise

Instructions

Step 1
Heat oil to 350 in a skillet or pan. While oil is heating up, put cornstarch, salt, and pepper in a Ziploc bag.

Step 2
Add shrimp to cornstarch mixture and shake until fully coated. Remove shrimp from bag and fry until light golden brown or shrimp appear pink under the breading. Drain on a paper towel until ready to use.

Step 3
Combine the mayonnaise, coconut milk & condensed milk in a sauce pan over medium high heat. Heat until it comes to a boil, continuously stirring to prevent burning – about 5 minutes.

Step 4
Toss shrimp into coconut mixture and bring just to a boil, then turn off the skillet.
