To set up react environment:

Open command line and use the 'cd' command to navigate to the folder of your choice. 
Run the command: 'npm install create-react-app'
Run the command: 'npx create-react-app myapp'. Replace 'myapp' with name of choice
Run the command: 'npm install firebase react-firebase-hooks'. This installs the firebase library.

Open App.js in your IDE of choice and begin coding. To run the web app run the command 'npm start' on the command line in your 'myapp' folder

You should be able to just clone the repository on your computer, and just run npm install in the command line. Everything should hopefully be installed
