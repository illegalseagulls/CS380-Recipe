Simple creation of a relational database. Recipes, Ingredients, and RI tables. 
Recipes stores recipe names and recipeId, Ingredients stores ingredient names and ingredientId. Both of these tables have unique values. Only one of each ingredient will be in the ingredient table
The RI table is where duplicate values are found (i.e., if recipe 1 and 3 contain oil, then Oil will be found in this table twice with the corresponding keys)
