NEW ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE:

- within "_Main" you will find files relavent to the current project. At the moment,
we still need to link the UI version of the project (found in cs380-app) with the firebase
project, (which has been renamed from "React" to "ReactFirebase")

- Old files that are okay to delete are put into OLDCODE_

- RecipeList and User Test have been left in because they are useful
