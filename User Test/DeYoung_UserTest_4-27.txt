Commnets from User about the Recipe_GUI.java

Allow for spaces when inputting data

Wants to see all the recipes in database, with a dropdown menu that lists the ingredients for those recipes.
Then have a search bar above that to search for ingredients as originally intended. (Cookbook with find feature)

DEV NOTES:
User thought that the software was more like a cookbook than a search engine. In my opinion, this would be very easy to implement and very useful
