USER TEST FOR SPRINT 1:

Test 1:

- Confusion over whether the testing worked or not
- understood after brief explanation
- appears that it will be much more viable after database is setup

Test 2:

- Found the concept to be interesting
- would like to see buttons for ingredients when we have gui implementation
- would help to have a list returned explaining the rest of the ingredients you may need

Test 3:

- More fundamental ingredients necessary such as eggs.
- Confused about output, much more in depth return would help
- Maybe just stating exactly what recipes that are avaliable instead of numbers would make sense
- Also stating what ingredients go to what recipe would help greatly

Dev Notes:

I noticed through my tests that overall people were fairly confused about the outputs and operation of the program, 
even after some level of explanation. I do think it would be easy to refine some of the more minor details, however,
I also think that most of this confusion and deeper issue will be solved with proper database implementation and frontend
design.
