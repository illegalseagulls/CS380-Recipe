Test 1:
User was confused about output
User was imagining the program to be more like pinterest, where once they search then different recipes would show up and they could choose to save one
User wanted it to be more like a digital cookbook
User didn't know if they should put ingredients in plural form such as "eggs" or just leave it as "egg"

Dev notes:
The user seemed quite lost and did not understand what the program was really meant to do. Could go with some clearing up and concision.
It also might be important to tackle that thought of plural forms of words.
