- No easy way to tell what page user is currently on

- No progress bar to tell how long the search is taking

- Clicked on 'Search' button twice and cancelled the current search. This was due to not knowing what was happening in the background.

- Was confused what "Ingredients to be searched for" meant on the 'Search Recipe' page.

- Liked the overall design of the 'Add Recipe' Page.
